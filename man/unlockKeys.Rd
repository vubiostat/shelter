\usage{
unlockKeys(
  connections,
  keyring,
  connectFUN = NULL,
  envir = NULL,
  passwordFUN = .default_pass(),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connections}{character vector. A list of strings that define the
connections with associated API_KEYs to load into environment. Each
name should correspond to a REDCap project for traceability, but
it can be named anything one desires.
The name in the returned list is this name.}

\item{keyring}{character. Potential keyring, not used by default.}

\item{connectFUN}{function. A function that takes a key and returns a connection.
the function should call `stop` if the key is invalid in some manner.}

\item{envir}{environment. The target environment for the connections. Defaults to NULL
which returns the keys as a list. Use [globalenv()] to assign in the
global environment. Will accept a number such a '1' for global as well.}

\item{passwordFUN}{function. Function to get the password for the keyring. Usually defaults `getPass::getPass`.
On MacOS it will use rstudioapi::askForPassword if available.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments passed to [redcapConnection()].}

\item{url}{character. The url of one's institutional REDCap server api.}

\item{otherKeys}{list. A list of other keys to retrieve. Each list element
must be a list with name, variable and connectFUN keys. The connectFUN
can be as simple as an id function `function(x) x` or something that
constructs a connection object or calls `stop` if it's invalid.}
}
\value{
If `envir` is NULL returns a list of opened connections. Otherwise
        connections are assigned into the specified `envir`.
}
\description{
Opens a set of connections to REDcap from API_KEYs stored in an encrypted keyring.
If the keyring does not exist, it will ask for password to this keyring to use on
later requests. Next it
will ask for the API_KEYs specified in `connections`. If an API_KEY does not
work, it will request again. On later executions it will use an open keyring
to retrieve all API_KEYs or for a password if the keyring is currently
locked.
}
\details{
If one forgets the password to this keyring, or wishes to start over:
`keyring::keyring_delete("<NAME_OF_KEY_RING_HERE>")`

Consistent behavior requires `options(keyring_backend=keyring::backend_file)` to
be set. It is recommended to place this in `~/.Rprofile`.

For production servers where the password must be stored in a readable
plain text file, it will search for `../<basename>.yml`. DO NOT USE
this unless one is a sysadmin, as this defeats the security and purpose of
a local encrypted file. The expected structure of this yaml file is
as follows:

\preformatted{
other-config-stuff1: blah blah
shelter:
  keys:
    intake: THIS_IS_THE_INTAKE_DATABASE_APIKEY
    details: THIS_IS_THE_DETAILS_DATABASE_APIKEY
other-config-stuff2: blah blah
other-config-stuff3: blah blah
}

For production servers the use of ENV variables is also supported. The connection
string is converted to upper case for the search of ENV. If a YAML
and ENV variable both exist, the YAML will take precedence.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that R is set to NEVER save workspace to .RData
as this *is* writing the API_KEY to a local file in clear text because
connection objects contain the unlocked key in memory. Tips
are provided in `vignette("shelter-best-practices")`.
